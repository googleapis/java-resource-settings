 *
 * <p>======================= ResourceSettingsServiceClient =======================
 *
 * <p>Service Description: An interface to interact with resource settings and setting values
 * throughout the resource hierarchy.
 *
 * <p>Services may surface a number of settings for users to control how their resources behave.
 * Values of settings applied on a given Cloud resource are evaluated hierarchically and inherited
 * by all descendants of that resource.
 *
 * <p>For all requests, returns a `google.rpc.Status` with `google.rpc.Code.PERMISSION_DENIED` if
 * the IAM check fails or the `parent` resource is not in a Cloud Organization. For all requests,
 * returns a `google.rpc.Status` with `google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT` if the request is
 * malformed.
 *
 * <p>Sample for ResourceSettingsServiceClient:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * try (ResourceSettingsServiceClient resourceSettingsServiceClient =
 *     ResourceSettingsServiceClient.create()) {
 *   SettingName name =
 *       SettingName.ofProjectNumberSettingNameName("[PROJECT_NUMBER]", "[SETTING_NAME]");
 *   Setting response = resourceSettingsServiceClient.getSetting(name);
 * }
 * }</pre>
